  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major health concern.
              Vitamin D deficiency is associated with high CRC incidence and
              mortality, suggesting a protective effect of vitamin D against
              this disease. Given the strong influence of tumour stroma on
              cancer progression, we investigated the potential effects of the
              active vitamin D metabolite 1$\alpha$,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3
              (1,25(OH)2D3) on CRC stroma. DESIGN: Expression of vitamin D
              receptor (VDR) and two 1,25(OH)2D3 target genes was analysed in
              658 patients with CRC with prolonged clinical follow-up.
              1,25(OH)2D3 effects on primary cultures of patient-derived colon
              normal fibroblasts (NFs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)
              were studied using collagen gel contraction and migration assays
              and global gene expression analyses. Publicly available data sets
              (n=877) were used to correlate the 1,25(OH)2D3-associated gene
              signature in CAFs with CRC outcome. RESULTS: High VDR expression
              in tumour stromal fibroblasts was associated with better overall
              survival (OS) and progression-free survival in CRC, independently
              of its expression in carcinoma cells. 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibited the
              protumoural activation of NFs and CAFs and imposed in CAFs a
              1,25(OH)2D3-associated gene signature that correlated with longer
              OS and disease-free survival in CRC. Furthermore, expression of
              two genes from the signature, CD82 and S100A4, correlated with
              stromal VDR expression and clinical outcome in our cohort of
              patients with CRC. CONCLUSIONS: 1,25(OH)2D3 has protective
              effects against CRC through the regulation of stromal
              fibroblasts. Accordingly, expression of VDR and
              1,25(OH)2D3-associated gene signature in stromal fibroblasts
              predicts a favourable clinical outcome in CRC. Therefore,
              treatment of patients with CRC with VDR agonists could be
              explored even in the absence of VDR expression in carcinoma
              cells.",

               examined the association between total vitamin D intake and
               risks of early-onset CRC and precursors among women enrolled in
               the Nurses' Health Study II. Multivariable-adjusted hazard
               ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for early-onset
               CRC were estimated with Cox proportional hazards model.
               Multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% CIs for
               early-onset conventional adenoma and serrated polyp were

               111 incident cases of early-onset CRC during 1,250,560
               person-years of follow-up (1991 to 2015). Higher total vitamin D
               intake was significantly associated with a reduced risk of
               early-onset CRC (HR for $\geq$450 IU/day vs <300 IU/day, 0.49;
               95\% CI, 0.26-0.93; P for trend = .01). The HR per 400 IU/day
               increase was 0.46 (95\% CI, 0.26-0.83). The inverse association
               was significant and appeared more evident for dietary sources of

               Vitamin D influences in vitro gene expression and cancer cell
               growth. We sought to determine whether oral vitamin D induces
               beneficial gene expression effects in human rectal epithelium
               and identify biomarkers of response. METHODS: Blood and rectal
               mucosa was sampled from 191 human subjects and mucosa gene
               expression (HT12) correlated with plasma vitamin D (25-OHD) to
               identify differentially expressed genes. Fifty subjects were
               then administered 3200IU/day oral vitamin D3 and matched
               blood/mucosa resampled after 12 weeks. Transcriptomic changes
               (HT12/RNAseq) after supplementation were tested against the
               prioritised genes for gene-set and GO-process enrichment. To
               identify blood biomarkers of mucosal response, we derived
               receiver-operator curves and C-statistic (AUC) and tested
               biomarker reproducibility in an independent Supplementation
               Trial (BEST-D). RESULTS: Six hundred twenty-nine genes were
               associated with 25-OHD level (P < 0.01), highlighting 453
               GO-term processes (FDR<0.05). In the whole intervention cohort,
               vitamin D supplementation enriched the prioritised mucosal
               gene-set (upregulated gene-set P < 1.0E-07; downregulated
               gene-set P < 2.6E-05) and corresponding GO terms (P = 2.90E-02),
               highlighting gene expression patterns consistent with
               anti-tumour effects. However, only 9 individual participants
               (18\%) showed a significant response (NM gene-set enrichment P <
               0.001) to supplementation. Expression changes in HIPK2 and
               PPP1CC expression served as blood biomarkers of mucosal
               transcriptomic response (AUC=0.84 [95\%CI 0.66-1.00]) and
               replicated in BEST-D trial subjects (HIPK2 AUC=0.83 [95\%CI
               0.77-0.89]; PPP1CC AUC=0.91 [95\%CI 0.86-0.95]). CONCLUSIONS:
               Higher plasma 25-OHD correlates with rectal mucosa gene
               expression patterns consistent with anti-tumour effects, and
               this beneficial signature is induced by short-term vitamin D
               supplementation. Heterogenous gene expression responses to
               vitamin D may limit the ability of randomised trials to identify
               beneficial effects of supplementation on CRC risk. However, in
               the current study blood expression changes in HIPK2 and PPP1CC
               identify those participants with significant anti-tumour
               transcriptomic responses to supplementation in the rectum. These
               data provide compelling rationale for a trial of vitamin D and

  abstract  = "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant
               carcinomas worldwide with poor prognosis, imposing an
               increasingly heavy burden on patients. Previous experiments and
               epidemiological studies have shown that vitamin D and vitamin
               D-related genes play a vital role in CRC. Therefore, we aimed to
               construct a vitamin D-related gene signature to predict
               prognosis in CRC. The CRC data from The Cancer Genome Atlas
               (TCGA) was performed as the training set. A total of 173 vitamin
               D-related genes in the TCGA CRC dataset were screened, and 17
               genes associated with CRC prognosis were identified from them.
               Then, a vitamin D-related gene signature consisting of those 17
               genes was established by univariate and multivariate Cox
               analyses. Moreover, four external datasets (GSE17536, GSE103479,
               GSE39582, and GSE17537) were used as testing set to validate the
               stability of this signature. The high-risk group presented a
               significantly poorer overall survival than low-risk group in
               both of training set and testing sets. Besides, the areas under
               the curve (AUCs) for signature on OS in training set at 1, 3,
               and 5 years were 0.710, 0.708, 0.710 respectively. The AUCs of
               the ROC curve in GSE17536 for 1, 3, and 5 years were 0.649,
               0.654, and 0.694. These results indicated the vitamin D-related
               gene signature model could effectively predict the survival
               status of CRC patients. This vitamin D-related gene signature
               was also correlated with TNM stage in CRC clinical parameters,
               and the higher risk score from this model was companied with
               higher clinical stage. Furthermore, the high accuracy of this
               prognostic signature was validated and confirmed by nomogram
               model. In conclusion, we have proposed a novel vitamin D-related
               gene model to predict the prognosis of CRC, which will help
               provide new therapeutic targets and act as potential prognostic

               deaths in 2018. Screening programs and new therapies have only
               marginally improved the survival of CRC patients. Immune-related
               genes (IRGs) have attracted attention in recent years as
               therapeutic targets. The aim of this study was to identify an
               immune-related prognostic signature for CRC. To this end, we
               combined gene expression and clinical data from the CRC data
               sets of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) into an integrated immune
               landscape profile. We identified a total of 476 IRGs that were
               differentially expressed in CRC vs normal tissues, of which 18
               were survival related according to univariate Cox analysis.
               Stepwise multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis
               established an immune-related prognostic signature consisting of

               predictive ability of this signature for 3- and 5-year overall

               (ROC), and the respective areas under the curve (AUC) were
               79.2\% and 76.6\%. The signature showed moderate predictive
               accuracy in the validation and GSE38832 data sets as well.
               Furthermore, the 8-IRG signature correlated significantly with
               tumour stage, invasion, lymph node metastasis and distant
               metastasis by univariate Cox analysis, and was established an
               independent prognostic factor by multivariate Cox regression
               analysis for CRC. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed a
               relationship between the IRG prognostic signature and various
               biological pathways. Focal adhesions and ECM-receptor
               interactions were positively correlated with the risk scores,
               while cytosolic DNA sensing and metabolism-related pathways were
               negatively correlated. Finally, the bioinformatics results were

               prognosis of different cancer subtypes is critical to achieve
               better therapeutic assistance. In colorectal cancer (CRC) the
               discovery of stable and consistent survival markers remains a
               challenge due to the high heterogeneity of this class of tumors.
               In this work, we identified a new set of gene markers for CRC
               associated to prognosis and risk using a large unified cohort of
               patients with transcriptomic profiles and survival information.
               RESULTS: We built an integrated dataset with 1273 human
               colorectal samples, which provides a homogeneous robust
               framework to analyse genome-wide expression and survival data.
               Using this dataset we identified two sets of genes that are
               candidate prognostic markers for CRC in stages III and IV,
               showing either up-regulation correlated with poor prognosis or
               up-regulation correlated with good prognosis. The top 10
               up-regulated genes found as survival markers of poor prognosis
               (i.e. low survival) were: DCBLD2, PTPN14, LAMP5, TM4SF1, NPR3,
               LEMD1, LCA5, CSGALNACT2, SLC2A3 and GADD45B. The stability and
               robustness of the gene survival markers was assessed by
               cross-validation, and the best-ranked genes were also validated
               with two external independent cohorts: one of microarrays with
               482 samples; another of RNA-seq with 269 samples. Up-regulation
               of the top genes was also proved in a comparison with normal
               colorectal tissue samples. Finally, the set of top 100 genes
               that showed overexpression correlated with low survival was used
               to build a CRC risk predictor applying a multivariate Cox
               proportional hazards regression analysis. This risk predictor
               yielded an optimal separation of the individual patients of the
               cohort according to their survival, with a p-value of 8.25e-14
               and Hazard Ratio 2.14 (95\% CI: 1.75-2.61). CONCLUSIONS: The
               results presented in this work provide a solid rationale for the
               prognostic utility of a new set of genes in CRC, demonstrating
               their potential to predict colorectal tumor progression and
               evolution towards poor survival stages. Our study does not
               provide a fixed gene signature for prognosis and risk
               prediction, but instead proposes a robust set of genes ranked
               according to their predictive power that can be selected for
               additional tests with other CRC clinical cohorts.",

               has a 25\% share of the global cancer burden. Up-to-date cancer
               statistics in Europe are key to cancer planning. Cancer
               incidence and mortality estimates for 25 major cancers are
               presented for the 40 countries in the four United
               Nations-defined areas of Europe and for Europe and the European
               Union (EU-28) for 2018. METHODS: Estimates of national incidence
               and mortality rates for 2018 were based on statistical models
               applied to the most recently published data, with predictions
               obtained from recent trends, where possible. The estimated rates
               in 2018 were applied to the 2018 population estimates to obtain
               the estimated numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in Europe
               in 2018. RESULTS: There were an estimated 3.91 million new cases
               of cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) and 1.93 million
               deaths from cancer in Europe in 2018. The most common cancer
               sites were cancers of the female breast (523,000 cases),
               followed by colorectal (500,000), lung (470,000) and prostate
               cancer (450,000). These four cancers represent half of the
               overall burden of cancer in Europe. The most common causes of
               death from cancer were cancers of the lung (388,000 deaths),
               colorectal (243,000), breast (138,000) and pancreatic cancer
               (128,000). In the EU-28, the estimated number of new cases of
               cancer was approximately 1.6 million in males and 1.4 million in
               females, with 790,000 men and 620,000 women dying from the
               disease in the same year. CONCLUSION: The present estimates of
               the cancer burden in Europe alongside a description of the
               profiles of common cancers at the national and regional level
               provide a basis for establishing priorities for cancer control
               actions across Europe. The estimates presented here are based on
               the recorded data from 145 population-based cancer registries in
               Europe. Their long established role in planning and evaluating
               national cancer plans on the continent should not be
               undervalued.",

  abstract  = "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant
               carcinomas worldwide with poor prognosis, imposing an
               increasingly heavy burden on patients. Previous experiments and
               epidemiological studies have shown that vitamin D and vitamin
               D-related genes play a vital role in CRC. Therefore, we aimed to
               construct a vitamin D-related gene signature to predict
               prognosis in CRC. The CRC data from The Cancer Genome Atlas
               (TCGA) was performed as the training set. A total of 173 vitamin
               D-related genes in the TCGA CRC dataset were screened, and 17
               genes associated with CRC prognosis were identified from them.
               Then, a vitamin D-related gene signature consisting of those 17
               genes was established by univariate and multivariate Cox
               analyses. Moreover, four external datasets (GSE17536, GSE103479,
               GSE39582, and GSE17537) were used as testing set to validate the
               stability of this signature. The high-risk group presented a
               significantly poorer overall survival than low-risk group in
               both of training set and testing sets. Besides, the areas under
               the curve (AUCs) for signature on OS in training set at 1, 3,
               and 5 years were 0.710, 0.708, 0.710 respectively. The AUCs of
               the ROC curve in GSE17536 for 1, 3, and 5 years were 0.649,
               0.654, and 0.694. These results indicated the vitamin D-related
               gene signature model could effectively predict the survival
               status of CRC patients. This vitamin D-related gene signature
               was also correlated with TNM stage in CRC clinical parameters,
               and the higher risk score from this model was companied with
               higher clinical stage. Furthermore, the high accuracy of this
               prognostic signature was validated and confirmed by nomogram
               model. In conclusion, we have proposed a novel vitamin D-related
               gene model to predict the prognosis of CRC, which will help
               provide new therapeutic targets and act as potential prognostic
               biomarkers for CRC.",

               has been investigated in epidemiologic studies. Various
               approaches have been used to estimate vitamin D status,

               of these). These measures of vitamin D status have been studied
               in relation to colorectal adenoma, precursors of cancer, and

               controls. We confirmed previously reported CRC risk associations
               between SNPs in the VDR, GC, and CYP27B1 genes. We also

               However, none of these SNPs were statistically significant after
               Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) multiple testing correction. When

               and prostate cancers. Relatively recent work has demonstrated
               vitamin D to be critical in immune function and therefore
               important in inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel
               disease (IBD). Because vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is
               increasingly prevalent around the world, with an estimated
               30\%-50\% of children and adults at risk for vitamin D
               deficiency worldwide, it could have a significant impact on IBD.
               Epidemiologic studies suggest that low serum vitamin D levels
               are a risk factor for IBD and colon cancer, and vitamin D
               supplementation is associated with decreased colitis disease
               activity and/or alleviated symptoms. Patients diagnosed with IBD
               have a higher incidence of colorectal cancer than the general

              We prospectively studied 1,598 patients with stage I to III CRC.
              We sought association between plasma 25-OHD and stage-specific
              survival and tested for interaction between 25-OHD level and
              variation at the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene locus. Blood was

              liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. VDR polymorphisms
              (rs1544410, rs10735810, rs7975232, rs11568820) were genotyped,

              all-cause mortality (P = .003). Adjusted HRs were 0.68 (95\% CI,
              0.50 to 0.90) and 0.70 (95\% CI, 0.55 to 0.89), respectively
              (highest v lowest 25-OHD tertile), particularly in stage II
              disease (HR, 0.44; P = .004 for CRC-specific mortality). We
              detected gene-environment interactions between 25-OHD
              concentration and rs11568820 genotype for CRC-specific (P = .008)
              and all-cause (P = .022) mortality, number of protective alleles
              (P = .004 and P = .018, respectively), and GAGC haplotype at the
              VDR locus for all-cause mortality (P = .008). CONCLUSION: In
              patients with stage I to III CRC, postoperative plasma vitamin D
              is associated with clinically important differences in survival
              outcome, higher levels being associated with better outcome. We
              observed interactions between 25-OHD level and VDR genotype,
              suggesting a causal relationship between vitamin D and survival.

              require further investigation.",

               has a 25\% share of the global cancer burden. Up-to-date cancer
               statistics in Europe are key to cancer planning. Cancer
               incidence and mortality estimates for 25 major cancers are

               Nations-defined areas of Europe and for Europe and the European
               Union (EU-28) for 2018. METHODS: Estimates of national incidence
               and mortality rates for 2018 were based on statistical models
               applied to the most recently published data, with predictions
               obtained from recent trends, where possible. The estimated rates
               in 2018 were applied to the 2018 population estimates to obtain
               the estimated numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in Europe
               in 2018. RESULTS: There were an estimated 3.91 million new cases
               of cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) and 1.93 million
               deaths from cancer in Europe in 2018. The most common cancer
               sites were cancers of the female breast (523,000 cases),
               followed by colorectal (500,000), lung (470,000) and prostate
               cancer (450,000). These four cancers represent half of the
               overall burden of cancer in Europe. The most common causes of
               death from cancer were cancers of the lung (388,000 deaths),
               colorectal (243,000), breast (138,000) and pancreatic cancer
               (128,000). In the EU-28, the estimated number of new cases of
               cancer was approximately 1.6 million in males and 1.4 million in
               females, with 790,000 men and 620,000 women dying from the

               epidemiological studies have shown that vitamin D and vitamin
               D-related genes play a vital role in CRC. Therefore, we aimed to
               construct a vitamin D-related gene signature to predict
               prognosis in CRC. The CRC data from The Cancer Genome Atlas
               (TCGA) was performed as the training set. A total of 173 vitamin
               D-related genes in the TCGA CRC dataset were screened, and 17
               genes associated with CRC prognosis were identified from them.
               Then, a vitamin D-related gene signature consisting of those 17
               genes was established by univariate and multivariate Cox
               analyses. Moreover, four external datasets (GSE17536, GSE103479,
               GSE39582, and GSE17537) were used as testing set to validate the
               stability of this signature. The high-risk group presented a
               significantly poorer overall survival than low-risk group in
               both of training set and testing sets. Besides, the areas under
               the curve (AUCs) for signature on OS in training set at 1, 3,
               and 5 years were 0.710, 0.708, 0.710 respectively. The AUCs of

               0.654, and 0.694. These results indicated the vitamin D-related
               gene signature model could effectively predict the survival
               status of CRC patients. This vitamin D-related gene signature
               was also correlated with TNM stage in CRC clinical parameters,
               and the higher risk score from this model was companied with
               higher clinical stage. Furthermore, the high accuracy of this
               prognostic signature was validated and confirmed by nomogram
               model. In conclusion, we have proposed a novel vitamin D-related
               gene model to predict the prognosis of CRC, which will help
               provide new therapeutic targets and act as potential prognostic

               been found to be associated with lower risk for colorectal
               cancer (CRC) in prospective studies. Whether this association is
               modified by genetic variation in genes related to vitamin D
               metabolism and action has not been well studied in humans. We
               investigated 1307 functional and tagging single-nucleotide
               polymorphisms (SNPs; individually, and by gene/pathway) in 86
               vitamin D-related genes in 1420 incident CRC cases matched to
               controls from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer
               and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. We also evaluated the association
               between these SNPs and circulating 25(OH)D in a subset of
               controls. We confirmed previously reported CRC risk associations
               between SNPs in the VDR, GC, and CYP27B1 genes. We also
               identified additional associations with 25(OH)D, as well as CRC
               risk, and several potentially novel SNPs in genes related to
               vitamin D transport and action (LRP2, CUBN, NCOA7, and HDAC9).
               However, none of these SNPs were statistically significant after
               Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) multiple testing correction. When
               assessed by a priori defined functional pathways, tumor growth
               factor $\beta$ (TGF$\beta$) signaling was associated with CRC
               risk (P $\leq$ 0.001), with most statistically significant genes
               being SMAD7 (PBH = 0.008) and SMAD3 (PBH = 0.008), and 18 SNPs
               in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) binding sites (P = 0.036). The
               25(OH)D-gene pathway analysis suggested that genetic variants in
               the genes related to VDR complex formation and transcriptional
               activity are associated with CRC depending on 25(OH)D levels
               (interaction P = 0.041). Additional studies in large populations
               and consortia, especially with measured circulating 25(OH)D, are

               diseases and multiple forms of cancer including breast, colon,
               and prostate cancers. Relatively recent work has demonstrated
               vitamin D to be critical in immune function and therefore
               important in inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel
               disease (IBD). Because vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is
               increasingly prevalent around the world, with an estimated
               30\%-50\% of children and adults at risk for vitamin D
               deficiency worldwide, it could have a significant impact on IBD.
               Epidemiologic studies suggest that low serum vitamin D levels
               are a risk factor for IBD and colon cancer, and vitamin D
               supplementation is associated with decreased colitis disease
               activity and/or alleviated symptoms. Patients diagnosed with IBD
               have a higher incidence of colorectal cancer than the general
               population, which supports the notion that inflammation plays a
               key role in cancer development and underscores the importance of
               understanding how vitamin D influences inflammation and its
               cancer-promoting effects. In addition to human epidemiological
               data, studies utilizing mouse models of colitis have shown that
               vitamin D is beneficial in preventing or ameliorating

              25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) after a diagnosis of colorectal
              cancer (CRC) influences survival outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
              We prospectively studied 1,598 patients with stage I to III CRC.
              We sought association between plasma 25-OHD and stage-specific
              survival and tested for interaction between 25-OHD level and
              variation at the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene locus. Blood was
              sampled postoperatively, and plasma was assayed for 25-OHD by
              liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. VDR polymorphisms
              (rs1544410, rs10735810, rs7975232, rs11568820) were genotyped,
              and haplotypes were inferred by using BEAGLE software. We tested
              for association between survival and 25-OHD, VDR
              genotype/haplotype, and after applying a VDR genotype-25-OHD
              interaction term. We conducted Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and
              used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate adjusted hazard
              ratios (HRs). RESULTS: We found strong associations between
              plasma 25-OHD concentration and CRC-specific (P = .008) and
              all-cause mortality (P = .003). Adjusted HRs were 0.68 (95\% CI,
              0.50 to 0.90) and 0.70 (95\% CI, 0.55 to 0.89), respectively
              (highest v lowest 25-OHD tertile), particularly in stage II
              disease (HR, 0.44; P = .004 for CRC-specific mortality). We
              detected gene-environment interactions between 25-OHD
              concentration and rs11568820 genotype for CRC-specific (P = .008)
              and all-cause (P = .022) mortality, number of protective alleles
              (P = .004 and P = .018, respectively), and GAGC haplotype at the
              VDR locus for all-cause mortality (P = .008). CONCLUSION: In
              patients with stage I to III CRC, postoperative plasma vitamin D
              is associated with clinically important differences in survival
              outcome, higher levels being associated with better outcome. We
              observed interactions between 25-OHD level and VDR genotype,
              suggesting a causal relationship between vitamin D and survival.
              The influence of vitamin D supplementation on CRC outcome will
              require further investigation.",
