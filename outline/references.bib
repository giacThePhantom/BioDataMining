  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: Europe contains 9\% of the world population but
               has a 25\% share of the global cancer burden. Up-to-date cancer
               statistics in Europe are key to cancer planning. Cancer
               incidence and mortality estimates for 25 major cancers are
               presented for the 40 countries in the four United
               Nations-defined areas of Europe and for Europe and the European
               Union (EU-28) for 2018. METHODS: Estimates of national incidence
               and mortality rates for 2018 were based on statistical models
               applied to the most recently published data, with predictions
               obtained from recent trends, where possible. The estimated rates
               in 2018 were applied to the 2018 population estimates to obtain
               the estimated numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in Europe
               in 2018. RESULTS: There were an estimated 3.91 million new cases
               of cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) and 1.93 million
               deaths from cancer in Europe in 2018. The most common cancer
               sites were cancers of the female breast (523,000 cases),
               followed by colorectal (500,000), lung (470,000) and prostate
               cancer (450,000). These four cancers represent half of the
               overall burden of cancer in Europe. The most common causes of
               death from cancer were cancers of the lung (388,000 deaths),
               colorectal (243,000), breast (138,000) and pancreatic cancer
               (128,000). In the EU-28, the estimated number of new cases of
               cancer was approximately 1.6 million in males and 1.4 million in
               females, with 790,000 men and 620,000 women dying from the
               disease in the same year. CONCLUSION: The present estimates of
               the cancer burden in Europe alongside a description of the
               profiles of common cancers at the national and regional level
               provide a basis for establishing priorities for cancer control
               actions across Europe. The estimates presented here are based on
               the recorded data from 145 population-based cancer registries in
               Europe. Their long established role in planning and evaluating
               national cancer plans on the continent should not be
               undervalued.",

  abstract  = "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant
               carcinomas worldwide with poor prognosis, imposing an
               increasingly heavy burden on patients. Previous experiments and
               epidemiological studies have shown that vitamin D and vitamin
               D-related genes play a vital role in CRC. Therefore, we aimed to
               construct a vitamin D-related gene signature to predict
               prognosis in CRC. The CRC data from The Cancer Genome Atlas
               (TCGA) was performed as the training set. A total of 173 vitamin
               D-related genes in the TCGA CRC dataset were screened, and 17
               genes associated with CRC prognosis were identified from them.
               Then, a vitamin D-related gene signature consisting of those 17
               genes was established by univariate and multivariate Cox
               analyses. Moreover, four external datasets (GSE17536, GSE103479,
               GSE39582, and GSE17537) were used as testing set to validate the
               stability of this signature. The high-risk group presented a
               significantly poorer overall survival than low-risk group in
               both of training set and testing sets. Besides, the areas under
               the curve (AUCs) for signature on OS in training set at 1, 3,
               and 5 years were 0.710, 0.708, 0.710 respectively. The AUCs of
               the ROC curve in GSE17536 for 1, 3, and 5 years were 0.649,
               0.654, and 0.694. These results indicated the vitamin D-related
               gene signature model could effectively predict the survival
               status of CRC patients. This vitamin D-related gene signature
               was also correlated with TNM stage in CRC clinical parameters,
               and the higher risk score from this model was companied with
               higher clinical stage. Furthermore, the high accuracy of this
               prognostic signature was validated and confirmed by nomogram
               model. In conclusion, we have proposed a novel vitamin D-related
               gene model to predict the prognosis of CRC, which will help
               provide new therapeutic targets and act as potential prognostic
               biomarkers for CRC.",

               the relation between vitamin D status and colorectal cancer risk
               has been investigated in epidemiologic studies. Various
               approaches have been used to estimate vitamin D status,

               surrogates or determinants of vitamin D (including region of
               residence, intake, and sun exposure estimates, or a combination
               of these). These measures of vitamin D status have been studied
               in relation to colorectal adenoma, precursors of cancer, and
               colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. In general, all lines

               modified by genetic variation in genes related to vitamin D
               metabolism and action has not been well studied in humans. We
               investigated 1307 functional and tagging single-nucleotide

               between these SNPs and circulating 25(OH)D in a subset of
               controls. We confirmed previously reported CRC risk associations
               between SNPs in the VDR, GC, and CYP27B1 genes. We also

               However, none of these SNPs were statistically significant after
               Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) multiple testing correction. When

               diseases and multiple forms of cancer including breast, colon,
               and prostate cancers. Relatively recent work has demonstrated
               vitamin D to be critical in immune function and therefore
               important in inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel
               disease (IBD). Because vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is
               increasingly prevalent around the world, with an estimated
               30\%-50\% of children and adults at risk for vitamin D
               deficiency worldwide, it could have a significant impact on IBD.
               Epidemiologic studies suggest that low serum vitamin D levels
               are a risk factor for IBD and colon cancer, and vitamin D
               supplementation is associated with decreased colitis disease
               activity and/or alleviated symptoms. Patients diagnosed with IBD
               have a higher incidence of colorectal cancer than the general

              used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate adjusted hazard
              ratios (HRs). RESULTS: We found strong associations between
              plasma 25-OHD concentration and CRC-specific (P = .008) and
              all-cause mortality (P = .003). Adjusted HRs were 0.68 (95\% CI,
              0.50 to 0.90) and 0.70 (95\% CI, 0.55 to 0.89), respectively
              (highest v lowest 25-OHD tertile), particularly in stage II
              disease (HR, 0.44; P = .004 for CRC-specific mortality). We
              detected gene-environment interactions between 25-OHD
              concentration and rs11568820 genotype for CRC-specific (P = .008)
              and all-cause (P = .022) mortality, number of protective alleles
              (P = .004 and P = .018, respectively), and GAGC haplotype at the
              VDR locus for all-cause mortality (P = .008). CONCLUSION: In
              patients with stage I to III CRC, postoperative plasma vitamin D
              is associated with clinically important differences in survival
              outcome, higher levels being associated with better outcome. We
              observed interactions between 25-OHD level and VDR genotype,
              suggesting a causal relationship between vitamin D and survival.
              The influence of vitamin D supplementation on CRC outcome will
              require further investigation.",

              cells lacking VDR. 1alpha,25(OH)2D(3) induced the expression of
              E-cadherin and other adhesion proteins (occludin, Zonula

               pathway and has been nominated as a prognostic biomarker for
               colorectal cancer (CRC). Increasing evidence suggests that
               circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in cancer initiation and
               progression; however, their diagnostic values in cancers as the
               new potential biomarkers are still not fully understood. In the
               present study, by using quantitative real-time polymerase chain
               reaction (qRT-PCR), we demonstrated that CYP24A1 and
               hsa\_circ\_0060927 were only transcribed in 33 and 25 out of 83
               CRC tissues, respectively. In these samples, we demonstrated
               that CYP24A1 was up-regulated in both linear and circular forms

               these transcripts are not expressed in many samples, the
               diagnostic role of these transcripts could be rejected. Taken
               together, for the first time, the results of our study
